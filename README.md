# Sorting
 This repository contains implentations and testing of various sorting algorithms.

 There is really only the one notebook here, but it is a fairly comprehensive presentation of many
 standard integer sorting algorithms (or anything with a partial ordering on it). While I wrote this
 primarily for my own practice, I believe it could be a useful document for anyone looking for basic
 theory, complexity, and from-scratch Python implementations of each.

 Of course, there is far better built-in sorting functionality in Python 3. Just look at how much
 faster even my very rough implementation of TimSort is compared to the others.
